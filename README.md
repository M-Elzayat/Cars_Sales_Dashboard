# üöó Car Sales & Weather Analysis Dashboard - Power BI Project

## üìå Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **Power BI Dashboard** that analyzes car sales performance alongside weather indicators to uncover patterns that may impact business decisions. It combines internal sales KPIs with external environmental data to enable data-driven strategies.

The data was cleaned and processed using **Python** and **Excel**, and visualized using **Power BI** with interactive dashboards, slicers, and drill-downs.

## üìä Dashboards Overview

### 1. **Sales Overview Dashboard**
Provides an in-depth view of:
- **Total Profit**: $78M  
- **Total Quantity Sold**: 58K  
- **Average Profit per Sale**: $7.84M  
- **Monthly Trends**: Profit and Quantity Sold by Month  
- **Regional Performance**: Profit and Quantity by City  
- **Product Analysis**: Sales by Car Model  
- **Interactive Map**: Customer Contacts by City  
- **Dynamic Slicers**: Model, Contact Name  

### 2. **Weather Indicators Follow-up Dashboard**
Highlights how weather variables may influence buying behavior:
- **Average Wind Speed**: 11.24 mph  
- **Average Visibility**: 8.12 mi  
- **Average Humidity**: 62%  
- **Average Temperature**: 52.21¬∞F  
- **Weather Breakdown**:  
  - Rainy vs Dry Days  
  - Foggy vs Clear Days  
  - Snowy vs Snow-Free Days  
- **Seasonal Trends**: Temperature across quarters  
- **Slicers**: City, Date Range, Weather Condition, Wind Direction  

### 3. **Key Influencers Dashboard ‚Äì Dealers & Weather**
Uses **AI-driven Key Influencers Visual** to uncover the top variables impacting unit sales and profit:
- Key variables include: Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, City, Car Model, and Weather Conditions  
- Left pane: Top influencing factors ranked by significance  
- Right pane: Bar chart comparing influence across categories  
- Built for interpretability and strategic planning

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Transformation (Python)

Data preparation was performed using **Jupyter Notebook** with the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`: for data manipulation and cleaning  
- `numpy`: for numerical operations  
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: for exploratory data visualization and insights validation  

### Key Cleaning Steps:
- Handled missing values  
- Converted data types  
- Created new features  
- Exported cleaned data to Excel/CSV for use in Power BI  

**Notebook file**: `Phones_Cleaning.ipynb`
